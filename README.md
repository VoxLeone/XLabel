# XLabel
Computer Vision image labels are metadata. So lets treat them accordingly.

As an experiment, I'm exploring the idea of embedding computer vision annotation data directly into an image's EXIF tags, rather than storing it in separate sidecar text files. This approach effectively bundles the labels with the image itself, simplifying the dataset's file structure. While it's a bit unconventional, it could offer unexpected advantages â€” especially for smaller or proprietary datasets, or for fine-tuning tasks where managing separate annotation files adds unnecessary overhead. 

## Code

Embedding annotation data into EXIF tags can be a convenient way to store metadata directly within the image file. This approach can simplify data management, especially when working with large datasets. However, it's essential to consider the limitations and potential drawbacks:

+ EXIF tags have size limitations, which may restrict the amount of data that can be stored. 
+ Not all image formats support EXIF tags (e.g., PNG, GIF). 
+ Some image processing tools or libraries might strip or modify EXIF tags, potentially leading to data loss. 
    
The provided code is just a starting point, but it can be improved for better error handling, flexibility, and readability.

```python

import os
import json

    """

        tag (str): EXIF tag to write to (default: UserComment).

    Returns:
        bool: True if successful, False otherwise.

        print(f"Error: File {file_path} does not exist or is not a file.")

    "labels": ["cat", "dog"],
    "bbox": [100, 150, 200, 250]

## To do: Semi-Automatic Labeling Pipeline

To integrate this approach into a semi-automatic labeling pipeline, the following steps are suggested:

+ Data Preparation:
  Develop a script to extract the EXIF data from the images and store it in a temporary format (e.g., JSON, CSV) for easier processing. 
+ Labeling Tool:
  Create a simple labeling tool that allows users to review the images and update the annotation data stored in the EXIF tags. This tool can be a web application, desktop application, or even a Jupyter Notebook.
+ Data Validation:
  Implement data validation checks to ensure that the annotation data is in the correct format and within the size limits of the EXIF tags. 
+ Data Storage:
  Design a data storage system that can efficiently store and retrieve the annotated images, along with their corresponding EXIF data. 
+ Pipeline Automation:
  Automate the pipeline by integrating the data preparation, labeling, and storage steps using scripts or workflows (e.g., Apache Airflow, GitHub Actions).
    
## Tools and libraries for building a semi-automatic labeling pipeline include:

+ Labelbox: A platform for data annotation and labeling. 
+ Hasty.ai: A platform for data annotation and active learning. 
+ OpenCV: A computer vision library for image processing and analysis. 
+ PyTorch: A deep learning library for building and training machine learning models.
