# XLabel
Image labels are metadata. So lets treat them accordingly.

As an experiment I want to serialize computer vision annotation data into EXIF tags intead of using a sidecar text file. The labels are thus embeded in the image itself. The idea here is to experiment with simplifying the dataset file system, by eliminating the sidecar text files. There may be unexpected gains that justify adopting this approach, at least for small and/or proprietary datasets and fine-tuning tasks. 

###Code

Embedding annotation data into EXIF tags can be a convenient way to store metadata directly within the image file. This approach can simplify data management, especially when working with large datasets. However, it's essential to consider the limitations and potential drawbacks:

    • EXIF tags have size limitations, which may restrict the amount of data that can be stored. 
    • Not all image formats support EXIF tags (e.g., PNG, GIF). 
    • Some image processing tools or libraries might strip or modify EXIF tags, potentially leading to data loss. 
    
The provided code is just a starting point, but it can be improved for better error handling, flexibility, and readability.

```python

import pyexiftool

def write_to_exif_tag(path, file_name, data):
    """
    Write data to the UserComment EXIF tag of an image file.

    Args:
        path (str): Path to the image file.
        file_name (str): Name of the image file.
        data (str): Data to be stored in the EXIF tag.
    """
    try:
        with pyexiftool.ExifTool() as et:
            et.write_metadata(f"{path}/{file_name}", {"UserComment": data})
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error writing to EXIF tag: {e}")

def read_from_exif_tag(path, file_name):
    """
    Read data from the UserComment EXIF tag of an image file.

    Args:
        path (str): Path to the image file.
        file_name (str): Name of the image file.

    Returns:
        str: Data stored in the EXIF tag, or None if not found.
    """
    try:
        with pyexiftool.ExifTool() as et:
            metadata = et.get_metadata(f"{path}/{file_name}")
            return metadata.get("UserComment")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading from EXIF tag: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
path = "/path/to/image"
file_name = "image.jpg"
data = "This is the data to be stored in the EXIF tag"

write_to_exif_tag(path, file_name, data)
read_data = read_from_exif_tag(path, file_name)
print(read_data)
```
###To do: Semi-Automatic Labeling Pipeline

To integrate this approach into a semi-automatic labeling pipeline, the following steps are suggested:

    1. Data Preparation: Develop a script to extract the EXIF data from the images and store it in a temporary format (e.g., JSON, CSV) for easier processing. 
    2. Labeling Tool: Create a simple labeling tool that allows users to review the images and update the annotation data stored in the EXIF tags. This tool can be a web application, desktop application, or even a Jupyter Notebook. 
    3. Data Validation: Implement data validation checks to ensure that the annotation data is in the correct format and within the size limits of the EXIF tags. 
    4. Data Storage: Design a data storage system that can efficiently store and retrieve the annotated images, along with their corresponding EXIF data. 
    5. Pipeline Automation: Automate the pipeline by integrating the data preparation, labeling, and storage steps using scripts or workflows (e.g., Apache Airflow, GitHub Actions).
    
###Tools and libraries for building a semi-automatic labeling pipeline include:

    • Labelbox: A platform for data annotation and labeling. 
    • Hasty.ai: A platform for data annotation and active learning. 
    • OpenCV: A computer vision library for image processing and analysis. 
    • PyTorch: A deep learning library for building and training machine learning models.
